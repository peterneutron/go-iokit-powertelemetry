# ⚠️ [DEPRECATED] go-iokit-powertelemetry ⚠️

**This repository is deprecated and no longer maintained.**

This project has been completely redesigned and renamed to **[powerkit-go](https://github.com/peterneutron/powerkit-go)**.

The new library offers a more robust, extensible, and cleaner API. All future development will happen at the new repository.

Please update your imports and dependencies to use the new module:
